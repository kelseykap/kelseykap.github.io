## **Hello**, I am a first year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Delaware.

* * *

## Research
I am currently a Research Assistant at [VIMS Lab](http://vims.cis.udel.edu/) at the University of Delaware under the supervision of [Dr Chandra Kambhamettu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BMVESLIAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research is focused on developing algorithms for motion analysis of sea ice. I am currently working on an algorithm that delivers drift and deformation products using an integrated traditional Computer Vision and supervised learning approach.

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, **sea ice** and **remote sensing**.
