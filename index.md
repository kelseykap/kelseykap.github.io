## **Hello**, I am a Computer Science Master's graduate, specialising in Computer Vision and remote sensing.

* * *

## Research
During my time completing my Master's at the University of Delaware, I worked as a Research Assistant at [VIMS Lab](https://bigdatavision.org/seaIceProjects/).
My research focused on the development of novel algorithms for the fine-scale motion analysis of Arctic sea ice from remote sensing data, using both traditional Computer Vision techniques and a Machine Learning approach.

My research interests and expertise include **Computer Vision**, **sea ice analysis** and **remote sensing**.

## Projects

Oct 2020 - Feb 2023: 
**SIDEx** (Sea Ice Dynamics Experiment). _Field support during the expedition (daily, real-time collection and analysis of satellite imagery acquired over the expedition site) and development of algorithms for fine-scale drift and deformation characterization of Arctic sea ice. See some of my results [here](http://bigdatavision.org/environmenthealth/projects.html) and my final thesis project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ie40TW9mYXJtuKKIeAVDcHwtCqkOXwJ_/view?usp=sharing)._


Oct 2019 - Nov 2019: 
**SCALE** (Southern Ocean Seasonal Experiment). _Six week expedition to Antartica aboard the S.A. Agulhas II as part of the Sea Ice Team. I developed, deployed and monitored a ship-based stereo camera system for acquiring calibrated sea ice images. See more on the expedition [here](https://scale.org.za/) and on my work [here](https://github.com/kelseykap/kelseykap.github.io/blob/master/thesis.pdf)._
