## **Hello**, I am a first year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Delaware.

* * *

## Research
I am currently a Research Assistant at [VIMS Lab](http://vims.cis.udel.edu/) at the University of Delaware under the supervision of [Dr Chandra Kambhamettu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BMVESLIAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research is focused on developing algorithms for motion analysis of sea ice. I am currently working on an algorithm that delivers drift and deformation products using an integrated traditional Computer Vision and supervised learning approach.

My research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning, sea ice and remote sensing.

## Projects

Oct 2020 - present: 
**SIDEx** (Sea Ice Dynamic Experiment). _I will be part of the Ground Support Team, providing sea ice fracture and lead formation analysis from satellite data during the field campaign in March 2021, and am developing sea ice motion analysis products using integrated satellite and buoy GPS data, that will be used for understanding the fine-scale strain and stress dynamics of the sea ice around the camp._

Dec 2020 - present: 
**MOSAiC** (Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate). _In collaboration with the Sea Ice Dynamics and SAR Drift and Deformation Teams, we are developing algorithms for drift and deformation analysis along with methods for fracture and lead formation prediction using Sentinel-1 data._ 

You can read more about these projects [here](./Projects.pdf).


Oct 2019 - Nov 2019: 
**SCALE** (Southern Ocean Seasonal Experiment). Six week expedition to Antartica aboard the S.A. Agulhas II. _I was a member of the Sea Ice Team. My responsibilities included ice coring, sea ice observations, buoy troubleshooting and deployment and the operation and maintenance of a Stereo Vision system I developed for my Honors project._ [](./antarctica.html).
