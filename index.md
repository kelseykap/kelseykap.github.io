## **Hello,**<br>
**I am a Computer Science Master's Graduate, specialising in Computer Vision and Remote Sensing.**

* * *

### RESEARCH
During my time at the University of Delaware at [VIMS Lab](https://bigdatavision.org/seaIceProjects/), my research focused on the development of novel algorithms for the fine-scale motion analysis of Arctic sea ice from remote sensing data, using both traditional Computer Vision techniques and a Machine Learning approach.

My research interests and expertise include **Computer Vision**, **remote sensing** and **spatial data analysis for environmental monitoring**.

### PROJECTS

<sup>Oct 2020 - Feb 2023</sup><br>
**SIDEx (Sea Ice Dynamics Experiment)** <br>
I designed and developed a novel Computer Vision algorithm for Arctic sea ice analysis (the final algorithm achieves best known spatial resolution and accuracy in motion estimation of sea ice at time of publication).
During the expedition, I also performed real-time monitoring and tracking of weather and sea ice activity for daily updates to the team in the field.
See some of my results [here](https://bigdatavision.org/seaIceProjects/) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ie40TW9mYXJtuKKIeAVDcHwtCqkOXwJ_/view?usp=sharing).


<sup>Oct 2019 - Nov 2019</sup><br>
**SCALE (Southern Ocean Seasonal Experiment)** <br>
I went on a six week expedition to Antartica aboard the S.A. Agulhas II as part of the sea ice core extraction and sea ice observations teams.
I designed, developed and deployed an integrated and calibrated hardware and software stereo camera and IMU system for acquiring sea ice data from the ship.
