### SIDEx

In March 2021 a distributed array of sensors and platforms will be deployed in an ice floe in the Beaufort Sea off the Alaskan coast to monitor sea ice stress, strain and drift over several months.

I will be part of the Ground Support Team, providing sea ice fracture and lead formation analysis from satellite data during the field campaign, and am developing sea ice motion analysis products using integrated satellite and buoy GPS data, that will be used for understanding the fine-scale strain and stress dynamics of the sea ice around the camp.

A combination of Sentinel-1 and MODIS satellite imagery will be used to track lead and crack formation around the camp. The ground support team will provide the field team with daily reports of the sea ice drift and fracture based on manual analysis.

### MOSAiC

In collaboration with the Sea Ice Dynamics and SAR Drift and Deformation Teams, we are developing algorithms for drift and deformation analysis along with methods for fracture and lead formation prediction using Sentinel-1 data. See more about the MOSAiC Expedition [here](https://mosaic-expedition.org/).

### SCALE

Six week expedition to Antartica aboard the S.A. Agulhas II. 

I was a member of the Sea Ice Team. My responsibilities included ice coring, sea ice observations, buoy troubleshooting and deployment and the operation and maintenance of a Stereo Vision system I developed for my Honors project.
